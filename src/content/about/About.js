                While working as a physical therapist assistant, I discovered a love for software development. Now, I am a <span className='highlight'>front-end software engineer</span> who is passionate about collaboration and problem-solving. With over two years of frontend development experience, I strive to make a lasting impact. By leveraging my past experience and continued skill acquisition, I find efficient solutions for complex challenges.

                Over the past two years, I've honed my skills in <span className='highlight'>JavaScript</span> and the modern front-end framework, <span className='highlight'>Angular</span>. I have successfully contributed to various projects, always prioritizing <span className='highlight'>user experience</span> and performance. My journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of the importance of clean, maintainable code and <span className='highlight'>effective communication</span> within cross-functional teams. I'm always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest industry trends to continuously improve my craft.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to connect with fellow professionals, share insights, and explore new opportunities that challenge me to grow both personally and professionally.

                Outside of my profession, <span className='highlight'>I love to read</span>. I tend to lean toward the fantasy genre but am not opposed to others, especially with a good book recommendation! <span className='highlight'>I love creative writing</span>, too. Whether I’m brainstorming story ideas or actively drafting one of my works in progress, I find it’s a wonderful way to express myself. When I’m not immersed in fictional worlds, I’m <span className='highlight'>gardening</span> or <span className='highlight'>hiking</span> with my partner to keep myself grounded.
